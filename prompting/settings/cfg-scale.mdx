## What is CFG Scale?

CFG (Classifier Free Guidance) Scale controls how closely the AI follows your text prompt. Higher values make the model adhere more strictly to your description, while lower values allow more creative interpretation.

## Effects of CFG Scale

- **Low CFG (4-7)**: More creative freedom, can deviate from prompt
- **Medium CFG (7-12)**: Balanced adherence to prompt with some creative interpretation
- **High CFG (12-20)**: Strict prompt following, potentially at the cost of aesthetics

## Finding the Optimal Balance

- Too low: Image may not represent your prompt well
- Too high: Image may have artifacts or unnatural elements
- Sweet spot: Typically between 7-11 for most models

## Model-Specific Considerations

Different models may have different optimal CFG ranges:

- Model A: [Specific recommendation]
- Model B: [Specific recommendation]

## When to Adjust CFG Scale

- Increase when: Your prompt isn't being followed closely enough
- Decrease when: Images look unnatural or have artifacts
- Experiment with: Complex or abstract concepts
