## What is a Seed?

In image generation, a seed is a number that initializes the random noise pattern the AI uses to create your image. The same seed, prompt, and parameters will produce the same or very similar results.

## Why Seeds Matter

- **Reproducibility**: Generate the same image again later
- **Variations**: Create different versions of the same basic concept
- **Troubleshooting**: Isolate variables when refining your generations

## Using Seeds Effectively

- **Random seeds**: Let the system choose for general exploration
- **Fixed seeds**: Use when you want to maintain composition while changing other elements
- **Seed journeys**: Incrementally change seeds to explore related compositions

## Saving and Sharing Seeds

- All BetterWaifu generations save their seed value
- Share seeds with others to let them build on your creations
- Combine with other parameter sharing for exact reproduction

## Advanced Seed Techniques

- **Seed interpolation**: Blending between two effective seeds
- **Seed banking**: Keeping a collection of seeds that work well for specific styles
