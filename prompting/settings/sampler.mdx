## What is a Sampler?

In image generation, the sampler determines how the AI model navigates the latent space to create your image. Different samplers produce different results in terms of detail, noise, and overall aesthetic.

## Available Samplers

BetterWaifu offers several sampling methods:

- **DPM++ 2M Karras** - Balanced quality and speed
- **Euler a** - Fast with good detail preservation 
- **DDIM** - Consistent results with fewer steps

## How Samplers Affect Your Image

- **Detail level**: Some samplers preserve fine details better than others
- **Noise characteristics**: Different noise patterns and textures
- **Generation speed**: Sampling efficiency affects generation time
- **Consistency**: Some samplers produce more consistent results
