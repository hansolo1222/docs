## What are Steps?

Steps represent the number of iterations the AI model takes to generate your image. More steps typically result in higher quality, but with diminishing returns after a certain point.

## How Steps Affect Generation

- **Quality**: Higher step counts can produce more refined details
- **Generation time**: More steps mean longer generation times
- **Resource usage**: Higher steps consume more computational resources

## Recommended Step Ranges

- **Low (20-30)**: Quick generations, rougher details
- **Medium (30-50)**: Good balance of quality and speed
- **High (50-70)**: Maximum detail for complex images
- **Very High (70+)**: Diminishing returns, mainly for specific use cases

## Model-Specific Considerations

Different models may have different optimal step counts:

- Model A: [Specific recommendation]
- Model B: [Specific recommendation]

## Tips for Choosing Step Count

- Start with medium steps (40) and adjust based on results
- Complex scenes with many details benefit from higher steps
- Simple compositions may look fine with fewer steps
- Consider balancing steps with other parameters like CFG Scale
