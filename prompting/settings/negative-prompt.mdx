## What is a Negative Prompt?

A negative prompt tells the AI what you don't want to see in your generated image. It helps avoid unwanted elements and improves the overall quality of your results.

## How Negative Prompts Work

The AI uses negative prompts to steer the generation away from certain concepts, styles, or quality issues. Think of it as telling the AI what to avoid while it creates your image.

## Common Use Cases

- **Quality improvements**: Removing artifacts, distortions, or low-quality elements
- **Style control**: Avoiding specific artistic styles that don't match your vision
- **Content filtering**: Excluding unwanted subjects or elements from your scene

## Effective Negative Prompting

- Be specific about what you want to avoid
- Start with common quality issues (blurry, low quality, etc.)
- Add specific elements to avoid based on your prompt
- Consider using model-specific negative prompts for best results

## Example Negative Prompts

```
low quality, blurry, distorted proportions, extra limbs, missing limbs, deformed hands, bad anatomy
```

```
watermark, signature, cropped image, out of frame, worst quality
```

## Balancing Positive and Negative Prompts

- Too restrictive negative prompts can limit creativity
- Focus on excluding what you definitely don't want
- Experiment with different combinations to find the right balance
