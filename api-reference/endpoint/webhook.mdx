## Setting Up Webhooks

Use webhooks to receive real-time notifications when your image generations complete or encounter errors.

### Creating a Webhook

- Specify a callback URL where BetterWaifu will send HTTP POST requests
- Configure event types you want to receive (e.g., "generation.completed", "generation.failed")
- Optionally add authentication headers

### Webhook Payload

Webhook notifications include detailed information about the generation:

- Event type
- Generation ID
- Status
- Result URLs (for successful generations)
- Error information (for failed generations)
- Original request parameters

### Security Considerations

- Use HTTPS for your webhook endpoints
- Validate webhook signatures to ensure requests come from BetterWaifu
- Implement retry logic in your webhook handler
