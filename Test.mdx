title: "LoRA Training Step #1: Install DAZ"
description: "Learn to create a LoRA using DAZ3D (or Blender) to create a base character for optimum consistency"

## Goal 

The goal of this series is to leverage the free software DAZ3D to create a framework for AI generation of original characters, thus bypassing the necessity for brute force methodology or inefficient rolling for lucky hits. This initial guide will help you install DAZ3D. 

## Requirements

- ~ 2 hours of time to watch a bunch of tutorials on DAZ if you don't know how to navigate around the program.  Less if you are a quick learner or watch videos at 2x speed
- Some hard drive space and a computer that meets the min specs of DAZ3D:

## Method

1. Head to [<u>https://www.daz3d.com/install-manager-info</u>](https://www.daz3d.com/install-manager-info)
2. Register for an account (immediately unsubscribe from their email spam). 
3. Download and install the Install Manager software. Don't use CMS / Content Manager that they push.  It's extremely slow and poorly made.  
4. Open, Sign in, and wait for the program to automatically install "DAZ Essentials". If it doesn't start automatically select the radio boxes along the left hand side and click "download"

## Summary

After installation, open DAZ3D and play around.  The interface is pretty easy once you get the hang of it.  On the left hand side is your content, in the center is your workspace, and on the left is the list of items in the scene, and all the dials to change things like poses, expressions, when a character is selected.

I recommend this video series by Jay Versluis aka WPGuru as a starting point.  He's a bit slow but the content is all well geared towards beginners.  The main thing you want to be able to do is load a figure in, add some hair, and make a few poses.  Then you'll need to know how to render images.
